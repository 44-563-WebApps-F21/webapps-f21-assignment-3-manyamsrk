        <p> Aquaman’s greatest enemies, Black Manta has a singular hatred for the King of Atlantis.
            For decades, Manta’s true name and motives were shrouded in mystery, 
            hidden behind his menacing oversize helmet. 
            In modern times, however, his true motivations have been revealed.</p>
        <p> But no matter the era, Black Manta has always inflicted a special kind of pain upon his archenemy, 
            cementing his reputation as one of the most ruthless and driven criminals in DC history.</p>
