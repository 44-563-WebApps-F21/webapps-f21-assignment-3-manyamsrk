        <h3>Ant-Man</h3>
        <p>Using a gaseous form of <b>"Pym particles"</b> kept in a compartment in his belt, 
            Ant-Man initially had the power to <b>shrink himself</b> 
            (and other people and objects along with himself) to the size of an ant and return to normal.
             Over time, he has acquired the ability to change size at will.</p>
